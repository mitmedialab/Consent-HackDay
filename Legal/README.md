[GDPR](https://github.com/mitmedialab/Consent-HackDay/blob/master/Legal/GDPR%20Markup.pdf)

Questions:

To what degree does a blanket “do not track me” cookie satisfy the GDPR requirements for specific consent?
Does a chrome extension give the data subject sufficient clear info?
What are the requirements of GDPR’s certification idea and how could we satisfy them? Could this act as an additional incentive?
What are the transparent icons GDPR speaks about, who defines them (UI task)?


Relevant GDPR:

Article 4.11 (consent definition)
Article 5 (this is what we are ensuring)
Article 6.1.a (how consent makes processing legal)
Article 7 (requirements for consent)
